Sandy's bamazon assignment


What the project does:
This app is a mini guitar center where you can search and buy for simple garage band materials such as:

Guitars, drums, public address (PA) systems, keyboards and AMPs .\m/ 


Why the project is useful?
I got to better understand the way mysql and node.js work together. 

How users can get started with the project?
To run this app we first go to the directory  called bamazon in terminal, then type 'node bamazon_customer.js' and hit enter.

This will show you what the store is selling, how much is in stock and how much it costs. Next enter a key and then enter an id for a product that you want. 

It will then prompt you with how much of that item you'd like to buy.
